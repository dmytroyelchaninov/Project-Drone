- **▶️ Resume Training**: Resumes paused training from saved state
- **🛑 Stop Training & Save**: Stops training and saves final model

#### Model Management

- **📂 Load Model**: Load previously saved model weights
- **💾 Save Model**: Save current model weights manually
- **🗑️ Reset Training**: Clear all training progress and start fresh

#### Training Status

- **Real-time Status**: Shows current training state (Active/Paused/Not Training)
- **Color-coded Indicators**: Green (active), Orange (paused), Gray (stopped)

## ⚙️ Training Configuration

### Episode Length

- **Default**: 12 seconds per episode
- **Configurable**: Adjust in the Parameters section
- **Calculation**: Automatically converted to simulation steps (12s ÷ 0.002s = 6000 steps)

### Auto-Save Settings

- **Frequency**: Every 10 episodes
- **Checkpoint Files**: `rl_checkpoint_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pth`
- **Final Model**: `rl_model_final_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pth`

## 🔄 Training Workflow Examples

### Starting Fresh Training

```
1. Select "AI Navigation" mode
2. Set episode length (default: 12s)
3. Click "🚀 Start Simulation"
4. Click "🎯 Start Training"
5. Monitor progress in real-time
```

### Pausing and Resuming Training

```
1. During active training, click "⏸️ Pause Training"
2. Checkpoint is automatically saved
3. Training status shows "⏸️ Training Paused"
4. Click "▶️ Resume Training" to continue
5. Training resumes from exact same state
```

### Resetting Drone Position (Keep Weights)

```
1. During or after training, click "🔄 Reset Position"
2. Drone returns to initial position
3. Training weights are preserved
4. Waypoint progress is reset
5. Can continue training from same weights
```

### Loading Previous Training

```
1. Click "📂 Load Model"
2. Select saved .pth or .pkl file
3. Model weights are loaded
4. Click "🎯 Start Training" to continue training
```

## 📊 Training Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics

- **Episode Count**: Current episode number
- **Reward**: Average reward over last 100 episodes
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful episodes
- **Exploration**: Current exploration rate (epsilon)
- **Waypoints**: Progress through waypoints (current/total)
- **Collisions**: Number of collisions detected

### Progress Bars

- **Training Progress**: Overall training progress (based on 1000 episode target)
- **Episode Progress**: Progress through current episode waypoints

### System Status

- **Physics Validation**: Background physics checking status
- **Background Logging**: Logging system status
- **Performance**: FPS and CPU usage monitoring

## 🎯 Training Strategies

### Continuous Training

- Start training and let it run for extended periods
- Auto-save every 10 episodes ensures no progress loss
- Monitor success rate to gauge learning progress

### Iterative Training

- Train for short sessions (50-100 episodes)
- Pause training to analyze performance
- Adjust parameters if needed
- Resume training to continue improvement

### Checkpoint Management

- Regular checkpoints allow experimentation
- Load different checkpoints to compare performance
- Reset training if learning stagnates

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Training Not Starting

- **Check**: Simulation must be running first
- **Solution**: Click "🚀 Start Simulation" before "🎯 Start Training"

### Training Appears Stuck

- **Check**: Training status indicator
- **Solution**: If paused, click "▶️ Resume Training"

### Poor Learning Performance

- **Check**: Success rate and reward trends
- **Solution**: Try "🗑️ Reset Training" to start fresh

### Model Loading Issues

- **Check**: File format (.pth for PyTorch, .pkl for simple Q-learning)
- **Solution**: Ensure file matches current RL implementation

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Hybrid Mode

- Combines manual control with AI assistance
- Both manual controls and AI training panels available
- Useful for guided training or manual intervention

### Custom Episode Length

- Adjust based on task complexity
- Shorter episodes (5-8s) for simple navigation
- Longer episodes (15-20s) for complex obstacle courses

### Training Interruption Recovery

- All training sessions are checkpoint-protected
- System crashes or interruptions don't lose progress
- Resume from last checkpoint after restart

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Training Efficiency

- **Episode Length**: Balance between learning time and episode completion
- **Auto-save Frequency**: Default 10 episodes balances safety and performance
- **Real-time Factor**: Increase for faster training (if hardware allows)

### Resource Management

- Monitor CPU usage in system status
- Pause training if system becomes overloaded
- Use background validation for continuous monitoring
