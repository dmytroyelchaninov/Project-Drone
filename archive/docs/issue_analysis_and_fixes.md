## Recommendations for Future Development

### 1. Real-Time Constraint Checking

Implement physics constraints directly in the simulation core to prevent violations at the source:

```python
# Example integration in simulator core
def validate_simulation_step(self, state, forces):
    # Check RTF bounds
    if self.real_time_factor > 100.0:
        self.real_time_factor = 100.0
        self.logger.warning("RTF capped at 100x for physics realism")

    # Check efficiency bounds
    if self.efficiency > 0.95:
        self.efficiency = 0.95
        self.logger.warning("Efficiency capped at 95% for physics realism")
```

### 2. Background Validation Optimization

- Reduce validation frequency from 50ms to 100ms intervals
- Implement adaptive validation based on system load
- Add validation result caching for repeated test patterns

### 3. Test Suite Improvements

- Add automatic physics validation to all test functions
