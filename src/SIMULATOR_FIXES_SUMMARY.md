# Simulator Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Physics Module Errors ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Missing methods in physics classes causing transmission errors

- Added `calculate_rpm_from_thrust()` method to `Propeller` class
- Fixed `get_ground_height()` method signature in `Environment` class to accept position parameter
- Added missing `get_wind_at_position()` and `get_air_density()` methods to `Environment` class

### 2. Keyboard Input Not Working ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Keyboard device wasn't properly communicating voltage commands to the drone control system

- Fixed keyboard device to return `'voltages'` key in poll data (required by poller)
- Added `'device_type'` and `'connected'` fields to device data
- Modified poller to properly extract voltage data from keyboard device

### 3. Drone Control Mode Issues ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Hub was starting in 'idle' mode instead of 'operate' mode for manual control

- Modified simulator startup to set hub go state to 'operate' after component initialization
- This enables manual control mode where keyboard inputs affect drone movement

### 4. Ground Collision and Physics ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Drone was falling through ground due to physics initialization issues

- Fixed transmission terrain mesh generation to use correct Environment method calls
- Physics system already correctly initializes drone at 1 meter altitude
- Proper voltage-to-thrust conversion now working

### 5. User Interface Improvements ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Users didn't know how to control the drone

- Added comprehensive keyboard control instructions to startup UI
- Added camera control and UI toggle instructions
- Improved startup sequence display

## How to Use the Simulator

### Starting the Simulator

```bash
cd src
python simulator
```

### Keyboard Controls

#### üöÅ Drone Control

- **SPACE** - Throttle up (increase altitude)
- **SHIFT** - Throttle down (decrease altitude)
- **‚Üë (UP)** - Pitch forward
- **‚Üì (DOWN)** - Pitch backward
- **‚Üê (LEFT)** - Roll left
- **‚Üí (RIGHT)** - Roll right
- **A** - Yaw left (rotate left)
- **D** - Yaw right (rotate right)
- **ESC** - Emergency stop

#### üñ•Ô∏è Camera Control

- **Mouse drag** - Rotate camera view
- **Mouse scroll** - Zoom in/out
- **R** - Reset camera position

#### üìä UI Toggles

- **F1** - Toggle sensor display
- **F2** - Toggle debug info
- **F3** - Toggle trajectory display

### Expected Behavior

1. **Startup**: Simulator shows configuration and keyboard controls
2. **Initialization**: All components load successfully
3. **Testing**: Component tests pass
4. **3D Visualization**: OpenGL window opens showing:
   - Green ground plane with grid
   - 3D drone model at 1m altitude
   - Real-time sensor data overlay
   - Physics simulation running at 100Hz

### Architecture Working Correctly

The complete voltage-based control architecture is now functional:

1. **Keyboard Device** ‚Üí Converts key presses to voltage commands
2. **Hub** ‚Üí Stores voltage data and sensor readings
3. **Drone Control** ‚Üí Reads voltage commands from hub input
4. **Transmission** ‚Üí Converts voltages to physics parameters
5. **Physics Engine** ‚Üí Simulates realistic drone physics
6. **3D Emulator** ‚Üí Visualizes drone state and environment

### Key Technical Details

- **Control Frequency**: 100Hz for precise control
- **Physics Update**: Real-time Euler integration
- **Voltage Range**: 0-12V per engine (hover ~6V)
- **Manual Control**: Direct voltage control of individual engines
- **Safety Features**: Emergency stop, voltage clamping, ground collision detection

## Training Mode

For AI training without UI:

```bash
python simulator --training
```

This runs the physics simulation at 1000Hz without OpenGL visualization.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Import Errors**: Check all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. **OpenGL Issues**: System will fall back to 2D pygame mode automatically
3. **Device Not Found**: Ensure pygame can initialize (may need to install pygame)
4. **Physics Errors**: Check that all physics methods are properly implemented

The simulator now provides a complete, working drone simulation environment as specified in the original prompts.md requirements.
